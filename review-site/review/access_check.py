# A copy of Sustenaut/auth's access_check.py: keep it in step with that file.
"""The team access check, for a site's server: has this person's access changed? Copy this file
into the site; standard library only. The contract, for other languages, is in the README
("Checking access on each request").

A site asks on each request it gets, never in the background: nothing here runs on a timer, so a
site nobody is using asks nothing, and an idle browser tab costs nothing. On a request it fetches
the realm's hash of its client's access state (or uses one fetched within hash_ttl seconds). If
that differs from the hash stored for this person, or their last full check is older than
full_every seconds, it does one full check at userinfo with their access token (session alive,
their roles now) and stores the answer. So an unchanged list costs Keycloak one small request every
hash_ttl seconds at most, however many people are reading.

If Keycloak cannot be reached, someone whose stored hash is still the last one known keeps reading
with their last roles; changes are refused, and so is anyone who cannot be vouched for.
